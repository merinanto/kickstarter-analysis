## Overview of Project

Project helps Louise to organize the play fever in efficient way based on the data on crowdfunding projects for 7 years.

### Purpose

Propose a Launch date and Goal amount which can make the play successful.
## Analysis and Challenges

Analysis is done by using pivot table and charts on the launch date and goals.
Pivot table and chart details are available at (merinanto/kickstarter-analysis/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx)
One of the challenges was manually entering the count if formulas for outcomes based on goals analysis.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Launch dates in May has more success rates and in December chance of successful plays is least.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Last Category for Outcomes Based on Goals analysis is greater than 50000 eventhough plays with goals = 500000 also included.
This may confuse the readers.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

April to August is the best month to have launch dates.
Also February is also good month to have dates. But September, October, November and December are very risky months.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Shows below 20000 has more success rate and when goal increases above 20000 success chance is rarer.
Also there is merger chance of success for  plays with goals above 50000 means there is always a small probability of successful even for  high goal plays.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Goals/pledges are set in different currencies which must  be standardized to determine more accurate outcome based on goals conclusion.
While creating Outcomes Based on Launch Date itâ€™s better to have country wise data so that whether summer vacation is influencing the success rate of plays can be investigated.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Graph with relationship between goals and pledges to show the success rate.
